                account. The accounts logged in are given a 30-day trial period during which they can log in through
                their Google account and store information in the Google account. However, after the 30-day trial
                period, they must subscribe to process that information further. Though the information will be stored
                on their Google account backup, they cannot access it without subscribing to the application. Only after
                the payment of the subscription fee can they access their account on the application along with all the
                information they stored.</p>
                <br>

            <li>Update/Correction: Users can update information within the application, excluding email address and
                essential details. The
                User email address and other necessary information cannot be changed in order to comply with data
                protection. This is important so that there is value created through the free trial period of the
                application that is unique to one particular User.</p>
                <br>

            <li>Deletion: Any User who wishes to delete their account and information registered with our Service can
                send an email to the address given below from the Google Account they registered with the Application
                and request deletion of their account. An option to delete directly from the application will not be
                provided for safety reasons. </p>
